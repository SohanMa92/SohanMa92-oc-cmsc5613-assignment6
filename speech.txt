Napoleon Bonaparte Speech - Farewell to the Old Guard
Soldiers of my Old Guard:
I bid you farewell. For twenty years I have constantly accompanied you 
on the road to honor and glory. In these latter times, as in the days 
of our prosperity, you have invariably been models of courage and fidelity. 
With men such as you our cause could not be lost; but the war would have been
interminable; it would have been civil war, and that would have entailed
deeper misfortunes on France.
I have sacrificed all of my interests to those of the country.
I go, but you, my friends, will continue to serve France.
